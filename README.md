## 🜁 What is the MUES Engine Protocol?

The **MUES Engine Protocol** is not therapy, advice, or identity feedback.

It is a structured **reflection system** built to help users confront the shape of their own thoughts, contradictions, and internal narratives— without judgment, bias, or memory.

MUES does not track you.  
It holds no past.  
It does not reward or punish.  
It simply reflects structure — and tests if your answers hold under pressure.

MUES exists to help users **see themselves**, **without projection**, **without shame**, and **without the illusion of fixed identity**.

To begin your session, open:

**[https://muesdummy.github.io/Mues-Engine/](https://muesdummy.github.io/Mues-Engine/)**

Then copy and paste the full prompt from the page into ChatGPT.
